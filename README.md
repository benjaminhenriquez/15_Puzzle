# 15_Puzzle 

This is an app I built as a Hopscotch Javascript Coding Challenge. I used React and Redux libraries to create a responsive single page application. Pieces can be moved one, two or three at at a time to solve puzzle. Puzzle must be scrambled before ready to play. If unsolvable, button can be clicked to randomize board once more.
